This is Mailbox the cat. She is curently 9 yrs old and enjoys raw chicken, pets, and cuddling. Do not leave your tea unattended around her, because she is known to place her head in the cup, freaking out that she's stuck, and thus knocking the cup over in her escape. ---  <strong> Now for some kitteh ipsum: </strong> Loves cheeseburgers i like big cats and i can not lie spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum so meow yet find a way to fit in tiny box under the bed.
